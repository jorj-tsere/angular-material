But why are the services I created not provided in the module?
If you open one of the services we created, you’ll notice they are set to providedIn: 'root' .
This is new in Angular 6, and officially called “Tree-shakable providers”.
Instead of the module providing all its services, it is now the service itself declaring where it should be provided.
There is no need to add it to the providers array in the @NgModule , the Angular team even discourages this.
